        <div>
          I started as one of the two designers in the company. We were responsible for the whole product. Jobs we were doing:
        </div>
        <ul> 
          <li>Identifying problems users having</li>
          <li>Competitor analysis</li>
          <li>Mocking up high-fidelity solutions fast (web and mobile)</li> 
          <li>Prototyping</li> 
          <li>UX copy</li>
          <li>Design system</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I've learned</h3>
        <ul> 
          <li>Expectation and reality of being a designer is totally different.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Initial phase</h3>
        <div>
          There were initial designs from an external team but they were not covering much of what stakeholders wanted. We learned a lot about influencer marketing. Stakeholders had the habit of talking about something only when it is designed We worked closely with the CTO and VP of product. I participated in determining product roadmap and feature sets. We brainstormed together and we were free to add any feature we think users would need/use. I was responsible for establishing the design system.
        </div>
        <h3>Mistakes at the initial phase</h3>
        We were working overtime and coming up
        with high-fidelity mock-ups really fast. 
        <div>
        <h3>Why is this a mistake?</h3>
          <div>
          Designing high-fidelity mockups before trying various solutions is not a good practice because it lacks flexibility in the design process. Also showing to stakeholders directly can limit the ability to make changes or explore different design options later on. Wireframes, on the other hand, are simpler, low-fidelity versions of a design that are used to establish the basic layout and functionality of a product. They are more flexible, allowing for more experimentation and iteration. It's better to use wireframes as a starting point and then move on to high-fidelity mockups when the design is more solidified.
          </div>
        </div> We didn’t conduct any user
        research or tests. (At the time I was not aware of how crucial this
        was.) Changing screens and details too often. No clear roadmap. **My
        Process** They come to me to add a new feature. Example: a document
        generator needs to be built. (Usually, it comes with a reference
        application.) I ask questions about the feature. Example: Can users
        leave comments? Are we going to have templates? They answer some and
        leave the rest to my understanding. Example: Yes, you can do it that
        way. I’ll leave you to it. Work on the overall layout, and “cover the
        breadth”, then we will discuss as we go through designs together. The
        problem: Features that they want to add are in most cases a whole
        application on its’ own. Time constraints don’t allow us to experiment
        with different solutions much. **Middle Phase** Development started as
        we were working on flows and changing/adding/removing elements As my and
        my colleagues’ workload increased, I needed to find a way to not get
        overwhelmed with what was on my plate. Ruthless prioritization. I
        reviewed resumes, conducted interviews and helped a new member of our
        team onboard. We learned that all of the efforts we put into the product
        are based on false assumptions. So we started to develop the interface
        from scratch. I learned the importance of taking notes. **Middle Phase
        Mistakes** Saying yes to everything. As our CTO stated, “everything is
        in our scope.” So when someone asks if we want to develop it in-house,
        the answer is yes. Since
