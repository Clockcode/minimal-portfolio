          <h2 className='font-semibold text-2xl'>Challenges Faced</h2>
          <p className='text-lg font-light'>Every company has itsâ€™ own problems. I believe designersâ€™ job is to define the problems and plan ways to mitigate them. That is what Iâ€™ve tried to do. Some worked some didnâ€™t. Here are some of them Iâ€™ve worked on and was successful.</p>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Ambiguous Requirements</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>Startups are known for their dynamic nature. Often, I found myself working with requirements that were not clearly defined. This demanded flexibility and a proactive approach to seek clarity. This meant constantly asking questions, seeking clarifications, and ensuring I was on the right trajectory. Regular feedback became my compass.</p>
          </div>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Constant Changes</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>In a fast-paced environment, change is the only constant. Adapting to new requirements, even mid-project, became a regular affair. This taught me the importance of adaptability and resilience. I also learned that documenting changes and keeping old design files organized avoids going on circles with a flow or page.</p>
          </div>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Tight Deadlines</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>One of the most formidable challenges I encountered at Viral Nation was the incredibly short time frames provided for design deliverables. In a startup environment, where agility and speed are often prioritized, I frequently found myself racing against the clock. In such scenarios, it's vital to prioritize tasks based on their urgency. Focusing on one task at a time not only boosts efficiency but also prevents the feeling of being swamped.</p>

            <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
              <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Be Open to Feedback</h3>
              <p className='text-lg font-light'>Design critiques can be tough, especially when they come from non-design stakeholders. Comments like "This doesn't look right" or "Can you make it pop?" were frequent. While these statements are vague, they indicate an underlying issue. My role is to decode these comments, identify the core problem, and address it specifically. Instead of getting defensive or trying to revamp everything, I learned to hone in on the exact concern and rectify it.</p>

            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Don't Be Afraid yo Try New Stuff</h3>
