          <p className='text-lg font-light text-center'>Their stand-alone platform, <span className='font-bold text-blue-500'>Influsoft</span> was a slow, feature-bloated product hell that agents hated to use.

          <p className='text-lg font-light'>Every company has itsâ€™ own problems. Problems differ but there is not much to do for you other than defining the problems and trying to fix it one by one. That is what Iâ€™ve tried to do. Some worked some didnâ€™t. Here are some of them.</p>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Ambiguous Requirements</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>Startups are known for their dynamic nature. Often, I found myself working with requirements that were not clearly defined. This demanded flexibility and a proactive approach to seek clarity.</p>

          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Constant Changes</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>In a fast-paced environment, change is the only constant. Adapting to new requirements, even mid-project, became a regular affair. This taught me the importance of adaptability and resilience. I also learned that documenting change avoids going on circles and not innovating.</p>

          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Tight Deadlines</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>One of the most formidable challenges I encountered at Viral Nation was the incredibly short time frames provided for design deliverables. In a startup environment, where agility and speed are often prioritized, I frequently found myself racing against the clock.</p>

          <h2 className='font-semibold text-2xl'>Takeaways</h2>
          <p className='text-lg font-light'>My time at Viral Nation was a steep learning curve. The initial months tested my patience and resilience, but as the days rolled on, I formulated some guiding principles that not only helped me meet expectations but also exceed them.</p>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Prioritize and Focus</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>In a compact design team, multitasking becomes the norm. At one juncture, I found myself juggling three projects simultaneously. In such scenarios, it's imperative to prioritize tasks based on their urgency. Focusing on one task at a time not only boosts efficiency but also prevents the feeling of being swamped.</p>
          </div>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Establish Continuous Communication</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>I realized that to truly excel, I needed to align with the company's vision and expectations. This meant constantly asking questions, seeking clarifications, and ensuring I was on the right trajectory. Regular feedback became my compass.</p>
          </div>
          <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <h3 className='text-blue-800 text-xl'>Be Open to Feedback</h3>
            <p className='text-lg font-light'>Design critiques can be tough, especially when they come from non-design stakeholders. Comments like "This doesn't look right" or "Can you make it pop?" were frequent. While these statements were vague, they indicated an underlying issue. My role was to decode these comments, identify the core problem, and address it specifically. Instead of getting defensive or trying to revamp everything, I learned to hone in on the exact concern and rectify it.</p>
